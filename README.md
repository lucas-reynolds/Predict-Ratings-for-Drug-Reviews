## Project Overview
Created a model that predicts whether a drug review will have a good rating solely from the review text.

## Problem Statement
Drug reviews provide important information to drug manufacturers, such as levels of customer satisfaction, successful outcomes, or negative side effects. Several websites exist with drug reviews that could potentially be scraped and used for analysis or product research. However, the rating scales and information required often differ from site to site. If we could predict whether or not a rating would be good based on the review text, we would be able to label reviews with missing ratings, standardize ratings across review sources, and better understand the factors that most influence a drugâ€™s rating.
