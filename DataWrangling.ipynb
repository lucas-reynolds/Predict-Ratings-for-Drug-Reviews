I called his doctor on Monday morning and she said to stick it out a few days. See how he did at school, and with getting up in the morning. The last two days have been problem free. He is MUCH more agreeable than ever. He is less emotional (a good thing), less cranky. He is remembering all the things he should.

My moods were out of control. I was depressed and hopeless one second and then mean, irrational, and full of rage the next. My Dr. prescribed me 2mg of Abilify and from that point on I feel like I have been cured though I know I&#039;m not.. Bi-polar disorder is a constant battle. I know Abilify works for me because I have tried to get off it and lost complete control over my emotions. Went back on it and I was golden again.  I am on 5mg 2x daily. I am now 21 and better than I have ever been in the past. Only side effect is I like to eat a lot.\"                                        \n",

       "1  \"My son is halfway through his fourth week of Intuniv. We became concerned when he began this last week, when he started taking the highest dose he will be on. For two days, he could hardly get out of bed, was very cranky, and slept for nearly 8 hours on a drive home from school vacation (very unusual for him.) I called his doctor on Monday morning and she said to stick it out a few days. See how he did at school, and with getting up in the morning. The last two days have been problem free. He is MUCH more agreeable than ever. He is less emotional (a good thing), less cranky. He is remembering all the things he should. Overall his behavior is better. \\r\\nWe have tried many different medications and so far this is the most effective.\"                 \n",

But it contained hormone gestodene, which is not available in US, so I switched to Lybrel, because the ingredients are similar. When my other pills ended, I started Lybrel immediately, on my first day of period, as the instructions said. And the period lasted for two weeks. When taking the second pack- same two weeks. And now, with third pack things got even worse- my third period lasted for two weeks and now it&#039;s the end of the third week- I still have daily brown discharge.\\r\\nThe positive side is that I didn&#039;t have any other side effects. The idea of being period free was so tempting... Alas.\"   \n",

The only downside is that it made my periods longer (5-6 days to be exact) I used to only have periods for 3-4 days max also made my cramps intense for the first two days of my period, I never had cramps before using birth control.

All that is history.  If you&#039;re ready to stop, there&#039;s a good chance that suboxone will put you on the path of great life again.  I have found the side-effects to be minimal compared to oxycontin.  I&#039;m actually sleeping better.   Slight constipation is about it for me.  It truly is amazing.
